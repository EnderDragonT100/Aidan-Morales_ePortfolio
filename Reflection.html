        <p style="background-color: white; width: fit-content;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            <b>Learning:</b> <br>When looking back on my learning experiences so far I would say that I am proud of the progress I have made in this major. I came into Bradley with little to none knowledege about programming or computer systems and how they really worked outside of the basics like the physical side of computers. Over these year I have had the opportunity to start to learn and use many different programming languages. For example I have learned Java, JavaScript, C++, CSS, HTML, and the start of Python. From taking these awesome classes at bradley I have been able to use these languages to make many amazing things. But there are still some areas I would like toimprove on the time I spend studding more because I want to learn more baout what I am doing to get a better understanding of everything we are learning so that I am able to use it better and do great things.<br>
            <b>Life Goals:</b> <br>At the current moment some of my life goals are to first graduate Bradley University. Once I Graduate I want to find a good job in either IT support or I would like to go into another field that I find intresting and want to learn more about. I want to be able to set myself up to have a well paying job so that I am able to travel. It is my goal to be able to see many places outside of the United States. <br> 
            <b>Leadership and Teamwork:</b> <br>Over the past few years I have gained many experiences that I feel has improved me overall as a person. Some of the experiences I have gone through are being on the exec board for my Fraternity for 3 years, being a manager at Pizza Hut for 2 years, and being a Robotics team leader. These opportunites have allowed me to learn many new skill to be a great leader for others. To be able to help push and improve themselves to do better. I feel that without these experiences I would not be the person I am today because they made me reflect on who I am as a person. <br>
